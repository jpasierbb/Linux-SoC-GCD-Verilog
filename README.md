# Linux-SoC-GCD-Verilog
This project emulates a System on Chip (SoC) that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using a Verilog module integrated with QEMU. A Linux kernel module manages communication between the hardware and user applications, demonstrating efficient hardware-software interaction for embedded and custom computing environments.
